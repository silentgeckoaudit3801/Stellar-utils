# Stellar Utils

Useful utilities and developer helpers for Stellar blockchain development.

Contents in this folder:

- `src/` - library source (exports used utilities)
- `tests/` - unit tests
- `frontend/` - example static demo for the utilities
- `backend/` - example Express API wrapping the utilities
- `contract/` - Soroban contract scaffold (Rust)
- `docs/api-reference.md` - full API reference with examples and best practices

Quick start

1. Install dependencies for backend (Node.js >= 18) and run tests:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm test
```

2. Run the example frontend (static page): open `frontend/index.html` in a browser.

Project layout and purpose

- `frontend/` - Minimal demo UI that uses the backend API or directly imports
  utilities for quick manual testing.
- `backend/` - Small Express server exposing endpoints like `/health` and
  `/generate-keypair` that call into `src/`.
- `contract/` - Starter Soroban contract demonstrating a simple escrow-like
  function; intended as a minimal template to extend.

API reference

See [`docs/api-reference.md`](docs/api-reference.md) for documented parameters,
return values, usage examples, and best practices for every exported helper.

Continuous Integration

This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows that run on every push and
pull request:

- `ci.yml` - root CI job that installs dependencies, executes unit tests,
  checks backend and frontend script syntax, validates frontend HTML, and
  builds both Soroban contracts.
- `build-contracts.yml` - isolated contract build workflow for `contract/`
  and `Stellar-Wallet-Dashboard/contract/`.

To run the CI checks locally, use:

```bash
npm test
node --check backend/index.js
node --check frontend/app.js
```

For contract verification, install the Rust toolchain and Soroban CLI locally:

```bash
rustup install stable
cargo install --locked soroban-cli
cd contract && soroban build
```

Dashboard examples

- `Stellar-Wallet-Dashboard/examples/generate-keypair.js`
- `Stellar-Wallet-Dashboard/examples/check-balance.js`

These scripts demonstrate how to use the shared Stellar utility library and
how to call the dashboard backend.
