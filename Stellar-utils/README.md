# Stellar Utils

Useful utilities and developer helpers for Stellar blockchain development.

Contents in this folder:

- `src/` — library source (exports used utilities)
- `tests/` — unit tests
- `frontend/` — example static demo for the utilities
- `backend/` — example Express API wrapping the utilities
- `contract/` — Soroban contract scaffold (Rust)

Quick start

1. Install dependencies for backend (Node.js >= 18) and run tests:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm test
```

2. Run the example frontend (static page): open `frontend/index.html` in a browser.

Project layout and purpose

- `frontend/` — Minimal demo UI that uses the backend API or directly imports
  utilities for quick manual testing.
- `backend/` — Small Express server exposing endpoints like `/health` and
  `/generate-keypair` that call into `src/`.
- `contract/` — Starter Soroban contract demonstrating a simple escrow-like
  function; intended as a minimal template to extend.

Continuous Integration

This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows that run on every push and
pull request:

- `ci.yml` — root CI job that installs dependencies, executes unit tests,
  checks backend and frontend script syntax, validates frontend HTML, and
  builds both Soroban contracts.
- `build-contracts.yml` — isolated contract build workflow for `contract/`
  and `Stellar-Wallet-Dashboard/contract/`.

To run the CI checks locally, use:

```bash
npm test
node --check backend/index.js
node --check frontend/app.js
```

For contract verification, install the Rust toolchain and Soroban CLI locally:

```bash
rustup install stable
cargo install --locked soroban-cli
cd contract && soroban build
```

Dashboard examples

- `Stellar-Wallet-Dashboard/examples/generate-keypair.js`
- `Stellar-Wallet-Dashboard/examples/check-balance.js`

These scripts demonstrate how to use the shared Stellar utility library and
how to call the dashboard backend.

Horizon retry handling

Horizon-backed helpers accept optional retry settings where applicable:

```js
await getBalance(publicKey, 'testnet', { retries: 3, delayMs: 500 });
await createPaymentTransaction(secret, destination, '10', 'XLM', null, 'testnet', { retries: 3 });
await submitTransaction(transactionXDR, 'testnet', { retries: 3, delayMs: 500 });
```

Retries are attempted for transient failures such as network errors, HTTP 408,
HTTP 429, and 5xx responses. Non-transient errors fail immediately. If all
attempts fail, the helper throws a clear `Horizon request failed after N
attempt(s): ...` message.
